            <h2>About the Author</h2>
  <p>Hi there! My name is Ohene Adjei, and I'm a web developer based in Accra, Ghana. I created 64devs as a way to help other developers find remote job opportunities, just like I did. When I'm not working on 64devs, you can find me writing blog posts on my <a href="https://oheneadjei.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@oheneadj</a> website, tweeting about web development on <a href="https://twitter.com/oheneadj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@oheneadj</a>, or contributing to open-source projects on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/oheneadjei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@oheneadjei</a>).</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting <a href="/">64devs</a>, and I hope you find your next remote job opportunity here!</p>
